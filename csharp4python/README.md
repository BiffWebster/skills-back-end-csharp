title: C# for Python Programmers
currentMenu: csharp4python
---

This set of lessons is for programmers that are comfortable with Python but are new to C#. They are unique in that they are written using an approach that builds on what you know about Python. Most concepts are introduced by first looking at an example of Python code, and then examining the relevant C# concepts. Along the way we will examine the strengths, weaknesses and differences between those two languages.
